- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trintix
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, pcs, programming...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and playing with python on the side...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment...
- 📫 How to reach me nowhere, not networking at the moment...
- I am not a native english speaker, but I have close to fluent reading, listening and writing capabilities... but if you hear me talk, prepare for a lot of stuttering
